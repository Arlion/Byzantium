ANNOUNCING BYZANTIUM LINUX V0.1a (Scarab)
Approved for: GENERAL RELEASE, DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED

Project Byzantium, a working group of HacDC (http://hacdc.org/) is proud to 
announce the release of v0.1 alpha of Byzantium Linux, a live distribution of 
Linux designed to fulfill a crucial role in the evolution of the Internet.  
That role is a rapidly deployable ad-hoc wireless mesh network which can 
augment or replace the current telecommunications infrastructure in the event 
that it is knocked offline (for example, due to a natural disaster) or 
rendered untrustworthy (widespread surveillance or disconnection by hostile 
entities).  Unlike other mesh networking projects Byzantium was designed to 
be run on any x86 computer with at least one 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless 
interface.  Byzantium can be burned to a CD- or DVD-ROM (the .iso image is 
just over 300 megabytes in size), booted from an external hard drive, or can 
even be installed in parallel with an existing operating system without risk 
to the user's data and software.  Byzantium Linux will then act as a node 
within the mesh and will automatically connect to other mesh nodes and act as 
an access point for WiFi-enabled mobile devices.

THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE!  Do NOT expect Byzantium to be perfect.  Some 
features are not ready yet, others need work.  Things are going to break in 
weird ways and we need to know what those ways are so we can fix them.  
Please, for the love of LOLcats, do not deploy Byzantium in situations where 
lives are at stake.

FEATURES:
- Binary compatible with Slackware v13.37, so existing packages can be 
  converted with a single command.
- Able to act as a gateway to the Internet if a link is available.
- Linux kernel v2.6.38.8

WHAT WE NEED:
- Developers.
- Developers!
- DEVELOPERS!
- No more Bill Ballmer impersonations.
- People downloading and running Byzantium to find bugs and tell us where the 
  problems are so we can fix them.
- People filing bug reports on our Github page 
  (https://github.com/Byzantium/Byzantium/issues).  We can't fix what we don't 
  know about!
- People submitting patches.
- People booting Byzantium and setting up small meshes (2-5 clients) to tell 
  us how well it works for you with your hardware.  We have a hardware 
  compatibility list on our wiki that needs to be expanded.
- People who can help us translate the user interface.  We especially need 
  people fluent in dialects of Chinese, Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu.
- People to help us write and translate documentation.
