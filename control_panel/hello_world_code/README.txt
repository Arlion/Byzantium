This is where I stick the scripts I use to learn how to use new Python modules
(like cnetworkmanager and dbus-python (bletch!)).  Basically, I screw around
with them to see what they do and figure out what values are important.  They
aren't actually part of Byzantium but these examples will help other coders
learn how to use the modules.  In short, I'm trying to shorten your learning
curve.
